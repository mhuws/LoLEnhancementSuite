LoLEnhancementSuite
==================

A set of patches for the League of Legends client to enhance and fix bugs.

These mods are for the version `0.0.1.101`. This number wont be changed until ALL mods are updated. While the patcher WILL attempt to patch versions above it, bad things may happen.

The offical LESs patcher will patch all mods into your League of Legends client.

## Mods

Stops the client from switching back to the home page after a queue is declined.

LoLClient.exe making your League of Legends lag? This removes the call to close the game when the lobby is closed, allowing extra performance gains for those potato machines.
